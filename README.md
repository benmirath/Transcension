Transcension
============
This is the source code base for a game project. It is still in a very initial state, and thus not much to look at (and I'm banking not worth stealing, thus why you've found it on here). Feel free to peruse what is here. If you'd like to reuse some of the code (unlikely), feel free, but please refrain from using it in any commercial product. 
Thank you.

P.S. How obvious is it that I don't know what README files are for (likely useless for this kind of project)?
